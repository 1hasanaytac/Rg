# Rg
A small python script that calculates the Radius of Gyration (Rg) of a protein.

## Description
This is a very small python script with a function that calculates the Radius of Gyration (Rg) of a protein given its .pdb structure file. It is adapted from the [PyMol script](https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Radius_of_gyration) to become a stand alone function indipendent of PyMol and capable of running on Python 3.

## How To Use
1. Run Rg calculation using the following command:

`python Rg.py FILENAME.pdb`
